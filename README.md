# Backup Portable Text into Markdown

Sanity Portable contents to markdown generator.
A tool I used for backing up my sanity contents to Markdown md. For further testing stuffs.

Add environment variables

```javascript
PROJECT_ID = <your_project_id>
DATASET = <dataset>
```

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.js
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.6. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
